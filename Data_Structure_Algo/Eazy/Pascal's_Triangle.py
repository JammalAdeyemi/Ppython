# Pascal's Triangle
# Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the 
# sum of the two numbers directly above it
# Example 1:
# Input: numRows = 5
# Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]

# Constraints:
# 1 <= numRows <= 30

### Thought Process and Concepts Utilized
# 1. Problem Understanding:
#- The task is to generate the first `numRows` of Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of numbers where each 
# number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
#- The challenge involves understanding the pattern of Pascal's Triangle and translating it into an algorithm that
# can dynamically construct each row based on the previous one.
#- A key aspect is recognizing that each row starts and ends with 1, and intermediate values are sums of two adjacent
# numbers from the previous row.

#2. Algorithm Choice:
#- Iterative Row Construction: Given the nature of Pascal's Triangle, an iterative approach is suitable for 
# constructing each row based on the previous row's values.
#- Dynamic Programming: This approach utilizes elements from the concept of dynamic programming, as each step builds
# upon the previous step's result.
#- List Manipulation: Using Python lists to store and access the elements of each row efficiently, as lists provide
# easy access to previous row elements needed for the current row's calculations.

# 3. Implementation Details:
#- Initializing the Triangle: Start with the base case of Pascal's Triangle, which is a single element `[1]`.
#- Building Rows: For each new row (from the second row to `numRows`):
    # - Initialize the row with `[1]`.
    # - Fill in the intermediate values by adding pairs of adjacent elements from the previous row (`pascal[i-1][j-1]` 
    # and `pascal[i-1][j]`).
    # - Complete the row with another `[1]` at the end.
#- Appending Rows: After constructing each row, append it to the Pascal's Triangle structure being built.

            return []

        # Initialize Pascal's triangle with the first row
        pascal = [[1]]

        # Generate each row
        for i in range(1, numRows):
            row = [1]  # Start each row with 1
            # Calculate the middle elements of the row
            for j in range(1, i):
                row.append(pascal[i-1][j-1] + pascal[i-1][j])
            row.append(1)  # End each row with 1
            pascal.append(row)
        return pascal

### Explanation
#- Base Case: If `numRows` is 0, return an empty list.
#- First Row Initialization: Start with the first row of Pascal's triangle, which is `[1]`.
#- Iterative Row Construction: For each subsequent row up to `numRows`:
  #- Start with `[1]` and then calculate each element as the sum of the two elements directly above it in the 
  # previous row (`pascal[i-1][j-1] + pascal[i-1][j]`).
  #- End the row with another `[1]`.
#- Appending Rows: Each constructed row is appended to the `pascal` list.

### Time & Space Complexities
#- Time Complexity: O(numRows²), as the algorithm iterates through each row and each element of the row, the time 
# taken is proportional to the square of `numRows`.
#- Space Complexity: O(numRows²), as the space used to store the triangle's rows and elements is also proportional
# to the square of `numRows`.
