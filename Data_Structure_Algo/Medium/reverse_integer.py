# When faced with the task of reversing an integer, my immediate focus is on handling the reversal in a way that is mindful of potential overflow issues,
# especially since we're working within the constraints of a 32-bit signed integer.
# The core idea is to reverse the integer digit by digit. To do this, I'd iteratively extract the last digit of the number and append it to a new 
# number that's being formed. This process continues until we've processed all digits of the original number. However, simply appending digits might 
# cause the new number to exceed the 32-bit integer limit. To prevent this, I plan to check if adding another digit would cause an overflow before 
# actually appending it.
# Another important aspect is handling negative numbers. My approach here is to initially ignore the sign of the input, reverse the absolute value of 
# the number, and then restore the sign at the end. This simplifies the reversal process as we don't have to deal with negative numbers during the 
# main part of our algorithm.
# So, in essence, the solution revolves around three key steps: handling negative numbers, reversing the number digit by digit, and ensuring that the 
# result stays within the 32-bit integer range. It's a method that marries simplicity with careful consideration of the constraints imposed by the 
# problem.
