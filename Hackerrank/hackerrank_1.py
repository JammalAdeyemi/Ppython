# there is an array of n integers called num. the array can be reduced by 1 element by 
# performing a move. each move consists of the ffg  3 steps:
# 1. Pick 2 diffierne elements num[i} and num[j], i is not eqaul to j.
# 2. Remove d 2 selected elements from the array
# 3. Add the sum of the 2 selected elements to the end of the array

# Each move has a cost associated with it: the sum of the 2 elements removed from the 
# array during the move. calculate the min total cost of reducing the array to one element.
