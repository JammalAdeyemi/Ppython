# Create a simple calculator application that asks a num to enter two numbers and the operation (e.g. +, -, x, etc.) that theyâ€™d like to perform on the numbers. 
# Display the answer to the equation. Every equation entered by the num should be written to a text file. 
# Use defensive programming to write this program in a manner that is robust and handles unexpected events and num inputs.
